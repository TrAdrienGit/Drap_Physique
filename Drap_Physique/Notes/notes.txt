0. Point => Vertex (Vertices)


1. What is the name of a segment between two vertices?

    ✅ Name: Edge

    ✅ Plural: Edges

    🔹 In geometry, especially in graph theory or when discussing polygons/polyhedra, the straight line connecting two vertices is called an edge.

2. What is the name of a primitive triangle formed by 3 points (vertices)?

    ✅ Name: Simplex (more precisely: 2-simplex)

    ✅ In everyday geometry: Triangle

    ✅ If you mean the most basic triangle (no extra vertices inside), it can also be called a primitive triangle or elementary triangle.

    🔹 In higher mathematics and computational geometry, the most basic shape formed by 3 non-collinear points is a 2-simplex (a triangle).
    🔹 In simpler terms or elementary geometry, it’s just a triangle.
